***DESCRIPTION OF OUR PROJECT:***

Our project, titled "Shaking the Earth: An Exploration of Global Earthquake Activity in 2020," aims to provide users with an interactive visualization of the earthquakes that occurred in January 2020. It caters to users interested in researching earthquake patterns and anyone curious about earthquake data.

***The main components and details of our project are as follows***

***API:*** We utilized the USGS Earthquake Catalog API to fetch earthquake data for the specified time period. The API link used in our project is: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02

***Visualizations:*** Our project primarily focuses on a map visualization. We used the leaflet.js library, which provides an interactive and customizable map component for displaying earthquake data. With this map, users can explore the locations and details of the earthquakes that occurred in January 2020.

***CSS Frameworks:*** We employed Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of our project. 

***Project Objective:*** The primary objective of our project is to display and explore earthquake activity worldwide during January 2020. By visualizing the earthquake data on an interactive map, users can gain insights into the distribution, magnitude, and other relevant information about the earthquakes that occurred during that period.
